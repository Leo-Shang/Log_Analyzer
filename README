High level description of the algorithm:
    Keep two lists named "finished_list" and "enter". "enter" keeps
    the record of running (not exit yet) function names and their starting
    time with a dirty bit detecting the existence of nested function call.
    "finished_list" is the list of tuples storing functions with their count
    and accumulated running time.

    Also, the program keeps the time consumed for the nested functions, called
    time_inside_nested.
    Therefore,for any given function, it is either nested or not nested:
        1. not nested: calculate as finish time - start time
        2. nested: calculate as finish time - start time - time_inside_nested

    At the end of program, report the tuples in "finished_list"


Note:
    The program is built on the assumption that the function enters and exits
    naturally:
        i.e.: If A() calls B(), then B() must exit before A() does. Otherwise,
        the program triggers error report(line 12 of solution.py)
